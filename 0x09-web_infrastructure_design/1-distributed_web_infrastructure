**Explanation:**

1. **User:** Represents the person wanting to access the website.

2. **Domain Name (www.foobar.com):** The domain name the user enters in their web browser.

3. **DNS Resolver:** Converts the domain name into an IP address using DNS.

4. **DNS Server:** Stores domain records and IP addresses.

5. **Domain Record (www.foobar.com):** Associates the domain name with the load balancer's IP.

6. **Internet:** Network for data transmission.

7. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):** Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers using a distribution algorithm. HAproxy is used here.

8. **Servers:** Multiple servers hosting the website.

9. **Nginx:** Web server that handles requests, serves static files, and acts as a reverse proxy.

10. **App Server:** Hosts application code, processes dynamic content, and generates responses.

11. **Application Codebase:** Contains the website's logic and files.

12. **Database (Primary-Replica Cluster):** Stores and manages application data.

**Additional Elements and Explanations:**

- **Load Balancer (HAproxy):** Added to distribute incoming requests across servers for load balancing, enhancing performance and redundancy.

- **Database (Primary-Replica Cluster):** Implemented to ensure data availability and redundancy. Primary node handles writes, while replicas handle reads.

- **Distribution Algorithm:** The load balancer uses a Round Robin distribution algorithm to evenly distribute requests among servers.

- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:** This setup is Active-Active, meaning all servers are actively serving traffic. In Active-Passive, only one set of servers is active while the others are on standby.

- **Database Primary-Replica Cluster:** Primary node handles write operations, ensuring consistency. Replica nodes handle read operations, improving scalability and performance.

- **Difference between Primary and Replica in Application:** The primary node handles write operations and updates to the database. Replicas handle read operations, providing faster access to data.

**Issues with the Infrastructure:**

- **Single Points of Failure (SPOF):** Load balancer, application servers, and database can become SPOFs if they fail.

- **Security Issues:** No mention of firewalls or HTTPS, making the infrastructure vulnerable to attacks and data breaches.

- **Lack of Monitoring:** No monitoring tools mentioned, leading to difficulty in identifying and addressing issues promptly.
