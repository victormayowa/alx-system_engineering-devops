**Explanation:**

1. **User:** This represents the person who wants to access the website at www.foobar.com.

2. **Domain Name (www.foobar.com):** The domain name is the human-readable address used to access websites. In this case, the user types in www.foobar.com to their web browser.

3. **DNS Resolver:** The DNS resolver is a component that converts the domain name (www.foobar.com) into an IP address (8.8.8.8) by querying the DNS server.

4. **DNS Server:** The DNS server stores domain name records and their corresponding IP addresses. It provides the IP address for the domain name requested.

5. **Domain Record (www.foobar.com):** This is a DNS record that associates the domain name www.foobar.com with the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

6. **Internet:** Represents the network through which data flows.

7. **Load Balancer (Nginx):** The load balancer distributes incoming requests from users to multiple application servers to balance the load. Nginx is a popular web server that can also act as a load balancer.

8. **Application Server:** This server hosts the application's codebase. It receives requests from the load balancer, processes them, and sends back responses.

9. **Application Codebase:** The application's code and files that run on the application server. It contains the logic to process user requests and generate responses.

10. **Database:** The database stores and manages data for the application. It is used to store and retrieve information as needed by the application.

**Roles:**

- **Server:** A server is a computer or system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- **Domain Name:** A domain name is a human-readable address that represents an IP address. It's used to access websites instead of remembering IP addresses.

- **www DNS Record:** The "www" record is a type of DNS record (a CNAME record) that points to the domain's main IP address.

- **Web Server (Nginx):** The web server handles HTTP requests and serves static files to users. It can also act as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

- **Application Server:** The application server hosts the application's code, processes dynamic content, and generates responses to user requests.

- **Database:** The database stores and manages structured data for the application, providing data storage and retrieval functionality.

- **Communication:** The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol for web requests and responses.

**Issues:**

- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If the single server goes down, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

- **Downtime during Maintenance:** When deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, leading to downtime during that period.

- **Scalability Issues:** The single server architecture limits the ability to handle high incoming traffic, potentially causing slow performance or crashes.
