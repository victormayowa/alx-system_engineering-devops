**Explanation:**

1. **User:** Represents the person wanting to access the secure website.

2. **Domain Name (www.foobar.com):** The domain name the user enters in their web browser.

3. **DNS Resolver:** Converts the domain name into an IP address using DNS.

4. **DNS Server:** Stores domain records and IP addresses.

5. **Domain Record (www.foobar.com):** Associates the domain name with the load balancer's IP.

6. **Internet:** Network for data transmission.

7. **Load Balancer (SSL Termination):** Handles SSL encryption/decryption and distributes requests to servers.

8. **Servers:** Multiple servers hosting the website.

9. **Firewalls (FW):** Added for network security, controlling incoming/outgoing traffic.

10. **Nginx:** Web server that handles requests, serves static files, and acts as a reverse proxy.

11. **SSL Certificates:** Enable HTTPS encryption, securing data transmission.

12. **App Server:** Hosts application code, processes dynamic content, and generates responses.

13. **Application Codebase:** Contains the website's logic and files.

14. **Database (Primary-Replica Cluster):** Stores and manages application data.

15. **Replicas:** Handle read operations, improving performance and scalability.

16. **Monitoring Clients:** Collect data for monitoring services (e.g., Sumologic).

**Additional Elements and Explanations:**

- **Firewalls:** Added for security to control and filter incoming/outgoing traffic, preventing unauthorized access.

- **SSL Certificates:** Serve traffic over HTTPS to encrypt data transmission, enhancing security and privacy.

- **Monitoring:** Used to track performance, diagnose issues, and ensure system availability.

- **Monitoring Data Collection:** Monitoring clients collect data on server performance, traffic, errors, etc., and send it to monitoring services.

- **Monitoring Web Server QPS:** To monitor web server queries per second (QPS), configure monitoring tools to track incoming requests.

**Issues with the Infrastructure:**

- **SSL Termination at Load Balancer:** Terminating SSL at the load balancer can expose encrypted data within the internal network.

- **Single MySQL Server for Writes:** A single MySQL server accepting writes can become a bottleneck and point of failure.

- **Homogeneous Servers:** Having identical components (database, web server, app server) can lead to limited flexibility and adaptability.

This design addresses security, encryption, and monitoring needs. For deeper understanding and implementation, further discussion is required.
